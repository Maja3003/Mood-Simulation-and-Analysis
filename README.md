# Mood-Simulation-and-Analysis
The goal of this project is to simulate and analyze the end-of-day mood based on various influencing factors such as activities, free time, social interactions, sleep quality, and weather. The project employs probability distributions to model these factors and generates a mood value for each simulation.
